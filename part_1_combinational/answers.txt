1-2. No questions

3.  Shifters

>> If the shifting is dynamic, the number of selectors needed is 16 and the size of signal carried by each selector is 16 bits. 

>> If the shifting is constant, no selectors are needed.

>> My barrel shifter has 4 stages that each implement a selector. Each selector carries a signal of size Vector#(16, Word), where Word is Bit#(16).
